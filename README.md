## Introduction
Java is a programming language that is based to object-oriented programming and which was created in 1991 by James Gosling. There are two main categories of Java: Standard Edition is mainly focused on the development of desktop applications; and Enterprise Editionis used for web applications and distributed systems.
It is possible to transfer functionalities from the standard version to enterprise, since java implements "Write Once Run Anywhere (WORA)", which also allows Java to be a multiplatform language that can be executed in different operating systems. Java interoperability is provided by its virtual machine called Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

To create applications in Java it is necessary to use the Java Development Kit, which is composed by:
Java Runtime Environment (JRE): The Java Virtual Machine.
Java Compiler: Translator from Java code to code that can run the virtual machine.
Development APIs: A collection of libraries that allows to develop applications more quickly.

Since JDK 11, Java has stopped being completely free, so its open source version has gained relevance. Open SDK is the Open Source version, which is completely free of Java Standard Edition.

## This&nbsp;repository

This repository contains the project that was developed throughout the Basic Course of Java. It contains two Java projects, one for OpenJDK 8 and another for OpenJDK 11. The purpose of these projects is just to apply the concepts reviewed in the Java Basics course:
- Variables
- Naming Convention: Camel Case
- Numeric Data Types
- Operators: increment and decrement
- Mathematics operator 
- Casting
- If Stament
- Else Statement
- Switch Stament
- Ternary Operator
- While Loop
- For loop
- Do While Loop
- Logical Operators
- Functions
- Javadocs
- Use of arrays
 
Most of the previously mentioned topics were exemplified for the OpenJDK 8, so you will see that there are many classes in the directory of that project. Each of the classes created included the main method, which is the entry point of the program, in order to separately execute each of the topics. For the OpenJDK 11, only the keywork var was revised, wich is a functionality that is available for the current versions of OpenSDK.

## Dependencies
- Install OpenJDK 8 and OpenJDK 11
- Install Intellj or another IDE thats supports OpenJDK.

## Run&nbsp;Code
You can run these projects using IntelliJ or another IDE.

## Notes

Most commits correspond to sections of the course in which the project code was changed.
