## Introduction
Java is a programming language that is oriented to object-oriented programming, however since version 8 it has included characteristics of functional programming. Since JDK 11, Java has been completely free, so its open source version has gained relevance. Open SDK is the Open Source version, which is completely free of Java Standard Edition.


## This&nbsp;repository

This repository contains the project that was developed throughout the Basic Course of Java. It contains two Java projects, one for OpenJDK 8 and another for OpenJDK 11. The purpose of these projects is just to apply the concepts reviewed in the Java Basics course:
- Variables
- Naming Convention: Camel Case
- Numeric Data Types
- Operators: increment and decrement
- Mathematics operator 
- Casting
- If Stament
- Else Statement
- Switch Stament
- Ternary Operator
- While Loop
- For loop
- Do While Loop
- Logical Operators
- Functions
- Javadocs
- Use of arrays
 
Most of the previously mentioned topics were exemplified for the OpenJDK 8, so you will see that there are many classes in the directory of that project. Each of the classes created included the main method, which is the entry point of the program, in order to separately execute each of the topics. For the OpenJDK 11, only the keywork var was revised, wich is a functionality that is available for the current versions of OpenSDK.

## Dependencies
- Install OpenJDK 8 and OpenJDK 11
- Install Intellj or another IDE thats supports OpenJDK.

## Run&nbsp;Code
You can run these projects using IntelliJ or another IDE.
