## Introduction

This repository was created for the basic Java course; it contains two Java projects, one for OpenJDK 8 and another for OpenJDK 11. The purpose of these projects is just to apply the concepts reviewed in the Java Basics course.

## Features

First, you can review the commits of the project; each of them corresponds to a specific part of the course, in which a specific topic is exemplified. Topics covered in the course include:
- Variables
- Naming Convention: Camel Case
- Numeric Data Types
- Operators: increment and decrement
- Mathematics operator 
- Casting
- If Stament
- Else Statement
- Switch Stament
- Ternary Operator
- While Loop
- For loop
- Do While Loop
- Logical Operators
- Functions
- Javadocs
- Use of arrays
 
Most of the previously mentioned topics were exemplified for the OpenJDK 8, so you will see that there are many classes in the directory of that project. Each of the classes created included the main method, which is the entry point of the program, in order to separately execute each of the topics. For the OpenJDK 11, only the keywork var was revised, wich is a functionality that is available for the current versions of OpenSDK.
